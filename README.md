# Take me by the Hand.

A London interactive tour guide.


## Introduction 

“Take me by the hand” is an interactive web app designed to explore and discover London. 
It has three main focuses: 

The first one is to help users choose where to go or what to do. In order to do so, we have reduced the possible options to choose from hundreds of places to visit, to six moods/categories. 

The second one is to give users the possibility to categorize places in an unconventional way. To do so, we enabled full customisation of each place: users can assign/remove moods. This ensures that each user has its own personalised experience.

The third focus is to give users a way of having a collection of places they want to visit. To enable this, places can be added to two lists: “Liked” and “Wishlist”. This gives yet another way of personalising the app content and function.
